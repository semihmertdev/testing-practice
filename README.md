2. **reverseString**: Reverses the characters of a string.
3. **calculator**: Provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4. **caesarCipher**: Encrypts a string using the Caesar cipher technique.
5. **analyzeArray**: Analyzes an array of numbers to compute average, minimum, maximum, and length.

npm install
npm test
```
